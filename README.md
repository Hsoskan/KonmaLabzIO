# Estate-Ledger
EstateLedger: Bridging Real Estate and Blockchain for a Decentralized Future.

**Introduction:**

EstateLedger is a decentralized application (DApp) for real estate transactions, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, security, and efficiency. The platform will also incorporate Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technologies to enhance its functionality and user experience. Additionally, EstateLedger will incorporate derivative contracts to provide additional financial instruments and opportunities for users.

**Blockchain:**

EstateLedger is building on the Cardano blockchain, using the Marlowe domain-specific language for financial contracts. The platform will include several smart contracts,

Base Contracts:
- Token Contract: Handles the creation and management of tokens representing stakes in property developments.
- Land Acquisition Contract: Manages the acquisition of land from landlords.
- Property Development Contract: Handles the stages of property development.
- Trading Contract: Manages the trading of tokens on the marketplace.
- Profit Distribution Contract: Handles the distribution of profits from property sales.
- Governance Contract: Manages the governance of the platform.
  
Derivative Contracts:
Derivative contracts are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset. In the context of EstateLedger, these could be based on the future price of properties or tokens, allowing users to speculate on price movements without having to buy the underlying asset. Here are some ways derivative contracts that will be implemented:

- Property Price Derivatives: These contracts will allow users to speculate on the future price of the properties being developed. 
- Token Price Derivatives: These contracts would allow users to speculate on the future price of the tokens that represent stakes in the property development.
- Risk Management Derivatives: These contracts will help users manage their risk. For example, a user who owns a stake in a property development might be concerned about the risk of the development being delayed or the property market declining. They could enter a contract that pays out if the development is delayed or if the property market declines.

**Internet of Things (IoT):**

IoT devices will be used to monitor and manage properties in real time. This will include:
- Smart Sensors: Track environmental conditions, energy usage, or occupancy status. Data from these sensors will be recorded on the blockchain for transparency and verification.
- Smart Locks and Security Systems: Enhance the security of properties.

**Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML):**

AI/ML will be used to analyze data and automate processes. This will include:
- Price Prediction Algorithms: Analyze market trends and predict property prices.
- Chatbots: Automate customer service.
- Document Verification Systems: Use natural language processing to verify documents.

**Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR):**

AR/VR will be used to enhance the property viewing experience. This will include:
- Virtual Property Tours: Allow potential buyers or renters to tour properties virtually.
- Augmented Reality Visualizations: Allow users to visualize changes to a property.
